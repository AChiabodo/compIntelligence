    "### Types of Fitness Landscapes\n",
    "- **Rugged** - many local optima\n",
    "- **Smooth** - one global optimum\n",
    "- **Deceptive** - local optima are more fit than global optimum, tries to trick you\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classic Benchmark Functions\n",
    "- **One Max** - the goal of this problem is to maximize the number of ones in a bit string and the fitness fn is the sum of ones in the string. It's a smooth landscape and very easy to solve : Unimodal, separable and not deceptive at all. Can give some insight into the performance of an algorithm if we follow the selection of the various individual.\n",
    "- **Knapsack Problem** - the goal of this problem is to maximize the value of items in a knapsack without exceeding the weight limit. We can have different variations of this problem, **multidimensional knapsack** (we have also constrain on the size of items), bounded knapsack, unbounded knapsack, etc. It's a rugged landscape and very hard to solve : multimodal, non-separable and deceptive. It's a good benchmark for testing the performance of an algorithm.\n",
    "- **Set Covering Problem** - the goal of this problem is to minimize the number of sets needed to cover all the elements in a set.\n",
    "- **15 Puzzle** - Classical problem that involves 15 sliding tiles in a 4x4 grid (one left void). The goal is to reach the goal state from a random state. A possible fitness function is the number of tiles in the correct position. \n",
    "- **Rastrign Function** - the goal of this problem is to minimize this non-convex function, typical benchmark used for evolutionary strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Evolution strategy in the One Max problem: We take two of the best solutions in our frontier and mix them up, for example taking half of the first and half of the second, evaluate the result and add it to the frontier. We repeat this process until we have a new frontier of the same size of the previous one. We can also add some random solutions to the new frontier in order to have a more diverse population.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representation\n",
    "- **fitness** - how well a candidate solution is able to solve the problem. Usually is one of the most difficult part to define in a problem.\n",
    "A bad fitness can void the differential survival (the different chances of survival of the candidate solutions) and the parent selection in our problem.\n",
    "- **Genotype** - the internal representation of the candidate solution and which is directly manipulated by the genetic operators. It's usually a bit string, but it can be also a tree, a graph, a vector, etc. Usually is transformed in order to compute the fitness.\n",
    "- **Phenotype** - the external representation of the candidate solution and which is directly evaluated by the fitness function. It's usually the same as the genotype, but it can be also different. For example, in the case of the 15 puzzle, the genotype is a bit string, but the phenotype is a 4x4 grid. Or in an expression we can have a *tree* as genotype and a *mathematical expression* as phenotype.\n",
    "If the Genotype can be directly evaluated by the fitness function, we have a **direct** representation, Genotype and Phenotype coincide.\n",
    "When we can have multiple Genotypes mapped to the same Phenotype, we have an **indirect**, and we can also have multiple Phenotypes mapped to the same fitness value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of mappings:\n",
    "We need to be able to do small changes at Genotype level that should bring us small changes in the fitness, that can also be called causality\n",
    "- **Mutation** -> single parent with small changes generates a new individual, that procedure can be repeated multiple times to enhance the difference between the parent and the child. We can have a variable /sigma that can be used to control the amount of change in the mutation ( rand() < sigma ).\n",
    "- **Recombination** -> We have two or more parents and the offspring must inherit **traits** (not only genes) from both parents.\n",
    "In general we aims to have both Mutation and Recombination in our algorithm, but we can also have only Mutation. We can't have only Recombination because that would lead to a loss of diversity in our population. \n",
    "In general the mutation brings small changes in the population (exploitation), while the recombination brings big changes (exploration).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Representation\n",
    "Virtually everything could be enconded as binary, but not all the times that can be usefull. Somethimes the encoding destroys the whole structure of the solution and gives bad results. For example representing a number in binary and try to flip a single bit (sometimes small changes othe times giant changes).\n",
    "A more reasonable representation is the **Gray Coding** that is a binary representation in which two consecutive numbers differ in only one bit. This is usefull because we can have a small change in the genotype that can lead to a small change in the phenotype.\n",
    "The mutation is a simple **bit-flip**\n",
    "The recimbination is a **crossover** that can be done in different ways:\n",
    "- **One-cut crossover** - we take a random point in the genotype and we swap the two parts of the genotype between the two parents. More likely to keep genes that are near each other in the genotype and never keeps together genes that are at the two ends of the genotype.\n",
    "- **N-cut crossover** - we take N random \"cuts\" in the genotype and we swap the parts of the genotype between the two parents. It's no more positionaly biased, but it's more difficult to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integer Representation\n",
    "Again, almost everything can be expressed as a number, but sometimes we could lose part of the solution structure. For example, if we have a solution that is a vector of integers, we can represent it as a single integer, but we lose the information about the vector. \n",
    "Another problem is given by categorical variables, for example the sizes S , M , L , XL are ordered and we don't lose too much information mapping them to 1,2,3,4\n",
    "We can have two types of mutation\n",
    "- **Random mutation** - we changes a random allele with another value\n",
    "- **Creep Mutation** - a random allele is increased or decreased by a random amount (big or small?)\n",
    "We can have different types of recombination\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permutation Representation\n",
    "Can also be seen as a special type of Integer representation, but we can have different types of mutation and recombination\n",
    "In this case our information can be stored in the **fixed position** or in the **order** or in the **sequence** (also *adjacency*) of elements that characterize our current solution (for example in the 15 puzzle we can have the position of the tiles or the sequence of the tiles).\n",
    "Now the random mutation does not make sense, and we need special operator for this type of representation, depending also on the problem that we're trying to solve.\n",
    "Possible Mutations:\n",
    "- **Swap mutation** - we swap two elements in the permutation\n",
    "- **Scramble Mutation** - we take a random subset of genes and shift their position\n",
    "- **Insert Mutation** - we take a random gene and insert it into another random position and shift all other genes\n",
    "- **Inversion Mutation** - we take a random subset of genes and invert their order\n",
    "Possible Recombination:\n",
    "- **Cycle Crossover** - we take a random cycle (continous subset) of genes from one parent and and then copy the other genes from the other parent. In this case we're selecting information from one parent and then use the other parent only to *\"fill the gaps\"*.\n",
    "- **Partially Mapped Crossover** - we take a random subset of genes from one parent and copy them to the offspring, then we take the other parent and copy the missing genes in the same order as the other parent. In this case we're selecting information from both parents and we're trying to keep the order of the genes.\n",
    "- **Inver Over** - is an Asymmetric Crossover, we first select a loci from the first parent and select the same from the second, then we take the subsequent loci from the second parent and insert it into the offspring, then fill with the subset from the first parent between the two loci selected. It's usefull to mantain relative order between two or more genes inside the genotype.\n"
