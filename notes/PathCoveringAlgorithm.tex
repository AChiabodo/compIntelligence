\section{Introduction}
This is a basic LaTeX file for the Path Covering Algorithm.

\section{Algorithm}
Here is the pseudocode for the Path Covering Algorithm:

\begin{verbatim}
1. Initialize the set of paths to be covered.
2. While there are uncovered paths:
   3. Select a path from the set of uncovered paths.
   4. Find a set of resources that can cover the selected path.
   5. Mark the selected path as covered.
6. End while loop.
7. Output the set of covered paths.
\end{verbatim}

\section{Conclusion}
This concludes the basic LaTeX file for the Path Covering Algorithm.
